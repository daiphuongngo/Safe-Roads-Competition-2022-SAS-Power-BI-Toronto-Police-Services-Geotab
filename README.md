# Safe-Roads-Competition-2022-SAS-Power-BI-SQL-Azure-Toronto-Police-Services-Geotab

## Overview

"SAS Institute, in partnership with Geotab Inc. and the Toronto Police Services, is hosting the fourth annual Safe Roads Competition, a virtual analytics competition for university and college students in Canada and Mexico.

Finals projects must be submitted by 5:00 p.m. ET on Friday, March 4, 2022. Final presentations will be assessed by a panel of industry judges on Friday, March 11, 2022."

For my project, I have chosen the Toronto case and also been using `Python`, `SAS`, `Power BI` to conduct analysis and visualize dashboards which are inspired by the [Toronto Police Service's Annual Statistical Report Interactive Dashboards](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/asr-analytics).

## Tools:

- SAS: explore data & generate main reports

- Power BI: visualize descriptive analysis

- SQL: query to deliver results on both SAS & Azure 

- Azure: store datasets, conduct descriptive analysis in SQL queries, examine diagnostics analysis and predictive analysis 

## Dataset:

(disclosed within the Case Study and the SAS Institute's registered Virtual Learning Environment only)

7 datasets for the Toronto cases retrieved from Toronto Police Service, Geotab and City of Toronto. We will narrow down to 3 datasets (2 from Toronto Police Services and 1 from geotab) for further analysis.
