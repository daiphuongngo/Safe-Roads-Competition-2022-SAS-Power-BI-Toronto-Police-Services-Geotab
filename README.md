# Safe-Roads-Competition-2022-SAS-Power-BI-Toronto-Police-Services-Geotab

## Overview

"AS Institute, in partnership with Geotab Inc. and the Toronto Police Services, is hosting the fourth annual Safe Roads Competition, a virtual analytics competition for university and college students in Canada and Mexico.

Finals projects must be submitted by 5:00 p.m. ET on Friday, March 4, 2022. Final presentations will be assessed by a panel of industry judges on Friday, March 11, 2022."

For my group of 2 people, we have chosen the Toronto case and we are currently working on that in `SAS` as the main tool. For me, I am also using `Power BI` to visualize dashboards which are inspired by the [Toronto Police Service's Annual Statistical Report Interactive Dashboards](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/asr-analytics).
